# Search for something precious

### Article name:
[Thank you Bethlehem for overflowing love](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/thank-you-bethlehem-for-overflowing-love)

So I read a letter written by Pastor John to his church expressing thanks and his enjoyment of the people's showing of their love to him and his wife. I really found it precious cause I see the goal of the Law of Christ which is Love. I also want this in my life and the life of the people around me.

I was now looking for the letter again but didn't know how to find it. I searched for some keywords using Google which I think was used in the letter like **took Noel shopping** and **labor of love** but could't find the letter from Desiring God. I also used the DG's search but couldn't find it.

Then I thought of getting all the articles in the **Bethlehem star** collection. I did the scraping (which was quite fast on my PC). After writing all articles to file, I used the **minisearch** js library to search for the phrase **Noel shopping** and I got the article:

### Thank you Bethlehem for overflowing love

Now I can read the letter and enjoy it again and pray God will do so among us also.

1. How to scrape in Nodejs

You can also use semantic searchs using vector embeddings. I figured that wasn't necessary.
